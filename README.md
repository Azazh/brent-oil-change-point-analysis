# Brent Oil Prices Analysis

## Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical Brent oil prices and additional datasets (e.g., GDP, inflation rates).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, outliers, and data type conversion).
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize trends, correlations, and patterns.
4. **Model Building**: Implement time series models (ARIMA, GARCH, LSTM).
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
6. **Insight Generation**: Summarize findings and provide actionable recommendations.

## Models
- **ARIMA**: Captures trends and seasonality.
- **GARCH**: Models volatility.
- **LSTM**: Captures complex patterns.

## Assumptions
- The data is stationary.
- External events significantly impact oil prices.

## Limitations
- Unforeseen global events may not be accounted for.
